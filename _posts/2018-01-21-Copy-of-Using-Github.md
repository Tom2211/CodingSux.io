    <td>In this lesson we (me and Peter Steward) had to figure out how to open the fuse editor (which was different to the one in the book!) and how to operate it. In the end it was because we were over-complicating the process and were expecting more. We learnt that Fuse basic is based off of python as it follows the same basic rules like the print function and the INK and PAPER variables which make up the basis of the programming language.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In lesson me and Peter got on well and we swapped jobs (programmer and Navigator) every ten or so minutes and we managed to get a lot done in the hour lesson. The only thing that hindered my progress was the keyboard on the fuse box. Compared to normal keyboards which use membrane keyboards (rubber domes) or mechanical keyboards (Like I am used to!) this keyboard uses sizer switches which don't give any feedback and all the keys feel the same so touch typing wasn't possible. Other than that the lesson went quite well</td>

    <td>Next time we will have already have learned how to find the editor and how to continue our progress. The keyboard issue is out of my control so I will just have to put up with it! Next week we should be able to set up and pack up quicker than this week so we can get more done.</td>
