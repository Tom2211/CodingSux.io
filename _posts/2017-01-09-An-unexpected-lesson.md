    <td>This lesson was rather unusual because of the power cut which occurred when we walked into the classroom and as result  this, Mr Keen had to teach us computers without the use of computers. We discussed many different topics ranging from the history of teaching to encouraging kids to be failures. I thoroughly enjoyed this lesson because of the many interesting topics and watching Peter trying to explain himself every two minutes.</td>

    <td>Well really what I said above but I would have enjoyed it more if we had focused more on the background scrolling concept as it was very interesting. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next week, hopefully we will have power and will be able to continue our scratch game-theory
 learning because I find it incredibly interesting but this may just be my general love of computers. </td>
