    <td>This lesson (like the last) me and peter took 15 minute turns as being navigator and programmer (like we are supposed to) The chapters we completed in the lesson were based upon variables and as I spend my spare time programming games in Java, Swift, C++, C* etc I understood the logic immediately.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even after completing two lessons I still find myself over complicating the work (probably because over the weekend I had been working on a swift project!) which means that we are not as far ahead as some others.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I need to stop over complicating the work and to do what the booklet says and not what I am passively typing through muscle memory.</td>
