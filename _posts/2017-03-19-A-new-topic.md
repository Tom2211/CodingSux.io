    <td>This lesson was rather different to our previous lessons (par the Unexpected one!) as we just discussed media, religion and politics. We were told not to believe everything we hear (and read!) as most of what we're told are lies! And how not all religions can be correct, as well as the concept of money and equality (also communism). </td>

    <td>Next week I think that I should try and make myself involved as this is a very important part of IT and general life skills. I find just listening to other people's thinking really interesting as it is another way of seeing the world.</td>

    <td>Next week I think we will be doing more hands-on work rather than listening as this lesson was an introductory lesson to our new topic of media. </td>
