Media Navigator Lesson 1 Homework

Name:Ben Watkinson       Date: monday 20th match 

Assignment: Select a media example. This could be a commercial, billboard, radio ad, or magazine ad. 

Answer the questions below:

Name of media example you deconstructed: online Computing website advertisement (Ralph lauren)

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Who is the target audience in this media example? (Be specific)</th>
    <th>What is the subtext (hidden or underlying message) in this media example?</th>
    <th>What are the untold stories
(what information is left out of the message)?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Male, 18-28yr olds as the ad is advertising a suit so it is aimed towards the working community. </td>
    <td>This ad is telling people that if you buy their suit, you will become a computing genius and own a huge mansion which implies money. </td>
    <td>The man in the ad is obviously photoshopped as 
His eyes are too central and there is no lense glare on his glasses although he is in a very bright room which reflective surfaces. Unless you were deliberately scanning the image, most people would not pick up on this as it is a small detail.</td>
  </tr>
