  <tr>
    <td>I have met my goal and am happy with today's work, I am hoping to get a significant amount done at home this week though. On top of what I planned to do, I have discovered a trip in the code which is causing the engines to rev up to incredibly high rpms which obviously isn't wanted in a realistic racing game!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that everyone just got on and did their own thing was a very good attribute to today's lesson. I hope that this attitude stays for future weeks to come as I find it a lot easier to be productive in this atmosphereâ€¦.</td>
