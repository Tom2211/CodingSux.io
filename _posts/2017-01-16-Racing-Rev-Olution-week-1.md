    <td>During this lesson we had to begin planning our scratch games by filling out the first two steps in our "scratch template planning sheet" which I did successfully whilst others decided to get into trouble by chatting on the original document. I am looking forward to continuing my game and starting to build the basic structure into scratch.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This week many people got in trouble because they were chatting when they were supposed to be working on their planning sheets so that took a large chunk out of the lesson which could of been used to progress our learning or lessen the length of our homework.

    <td>This week was almost perfect except from the google-docs chatting issue, I hope that next week that will not happen and we will be able to catch up with the other classes who are 2-3 weeks ahead of us.</td>
