    <td>This week I had to pay close attention to what was being told (I pay close attention anyway but today, even more so!) as it was something I hadn't covered before. This time, luckily people were a bit quicker at doing basic tasks so finally we had a more productive lesson than usual!!!

    <td>Pretty much what has been said in previous lessons plus what has been said above, mainly I think that I am doing well so that's all good! Maybe next week will not make me suffer the display error but who knows, something else might go wrong!</td>
