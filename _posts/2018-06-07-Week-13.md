    <td>For our third I was allowed to help others who were struggling with the exercises due to the fact that I had completed the codecadamy course for homework the previous week. Seeing as it had been a couple of weeks since I had last touched python I wanted to try and refresh my memory by watching and helping Milen do his. This helped me remember what I had done in the course and I then felt qualified to help others with similar problems.

    <td>The only factor which limited my learning was that I had completed the codecadamy course for homework so I had nothing condstructive  to do in the lesson. </td>

    <td>We will not have a lesson fit the next few weeks due to summer exams and half term week. After half term I will have it on a Thursday along with graphics due to our new timetable. In these weeks I should find some time to practice python so I can begin some challenges in the coming weeks. </td>
