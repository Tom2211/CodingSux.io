    <td>This lesson (in the 2nd half) we played a logic game called lightbot https://lightbot.com/flash.html which I found incredibly easy as it follows the basic concepts of JAVA coding. </td>

    <td>As I mentioned earlier, we had to complete a survey on child emotional wellbeing (childline!) . Most  questions I had no problem with but then came the segment which asks if you have a problem that's always on your mind so, to be truthful, I said i'm type one diabetic. This then caused the survey to ask me a whole series of questions which were absolutely useless, i.e 'have you ever thought how you could resolve the problem' and ‘have you considered a way that you can live with this problem’ see what I mean???</td>
