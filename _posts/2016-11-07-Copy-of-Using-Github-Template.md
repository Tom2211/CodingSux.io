    <td>During this lesson I had to improvise and persevere when things went wrong (the sccs rendering system corrupted but I edited the html system and fixed it) and in the end came out with a reasonably good looking webpage. May I ask of what you think?</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The time it took for a change to appear was horrendous (60 seconds) so my time management was a little off this week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next week we will have the results for our blogs (like this one!) so I will be able to take the advice I am given to put it towards making this page the best I can with the limited resources and knowledge I have.</td>
