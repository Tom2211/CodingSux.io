    <td>I carefully copied code into my characters and paid close attention to Mr Keene as I will need this for next week's lesson as we shall be tasked with making a really good maze game like the famous pac-man. At one point my display went fuzzy so I had a look at the displays cables and it seemed like they were all plugged in, I was wrong. It was really that the computer thought that the second display was the main one so it put its focus on it but with Mrs keenes help it began to work (sort of!).</td>
