    <td>Like the last two lessons, we spent the lesson just talking collectively about how everyday people are being lied to about a product i.e if you have a pepsi your taxi driver will become a racing driver or you will become a millionaire.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>Next lesson will be the same type of lesson again so I shall have another go at being more involved in conversation as this is a very important topic.</td>

    <td>Next lesson (after half term!) we will hopefully be doing more hands-on work rather than just
talking about issues. </td>
