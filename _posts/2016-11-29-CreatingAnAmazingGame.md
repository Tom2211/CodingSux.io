    <td>During this lesson we had to wait for long lengths of time for people to do the simplest of tasks so it became irritating very quickly and hopefully next week will be more productive. As a result of this we had to go through the basics of scratch again, which was a bit boring but I didn't complain as I know that there are some people who listen and still don't succeed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The time it took for people to do the simplest of tasks meant that the lesson was unproductive in my case. I also need to spell things correctly in scratch as it does not have a autocorrect system ( and that means no predictive typing, YAY!).</td>

    <td>Next week, hopefully people will not feel the need to take so long at everything purposely and maybe we can have a more productive lesson. Also next week, hopefully we will learn how to make our games more fun! </td>
