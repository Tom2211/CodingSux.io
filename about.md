I am computer enthusiast and car enthusiast in my spare time!

I am working on a game called 'The Racing Revolution' which is a car game which will feature some of the most powerfull and interesting cars ever made and a buitifull fantasy world, all made in house. We are set to release in september 2018 and will kickstart our company...

Our next big project is a mass multiplayer online game not to dissimilar to Club Penguin. Many people will wonder why we are commiting to a club penguin rip off but our justification is that the game will be an online platform which we can implement into our other games easily and we can make some profit from it. We are releasing this game in december 2019 as we need to be able to fund the multiplayer servers for the first few months of release before we make enough profit to pay for itself. 

Our endgame project is our closed loop serivce called 'Battlesuit 2.0'. You may wonder why '2.0' but its because I created an operating system called 'Project Battlesuit' and it worked well (only optimised for the components I was using at the time!). The closed loop system will work similarly to that of apple, the OS will only work on our hardware and our games will debut on this platform. This would be the project that funds everything else we do as it would mean that consumers would buy our PC with our software (so we dont need to pay for windows lisences anymore!) so they can play our games and use our programs with the best performance. The original was created using Python 2.0, Java, Ruby and the unix system and the successor will follow suit whilst adding C#, C++ (to improve the interface performace like how apple uses Metal 2.0) and Intel Optane SSO kernal built in. Release is looking like 2022 for the OS betas and 2024 for the full release including the OS, game launcher, cloud, PC lineup, gaming software and of course the games them selves.
